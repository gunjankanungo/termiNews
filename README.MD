Developers love to work from the terminal. Have you ever wanted to read your news in the terminal? terminews solves that problem! Simply run a global install of the npm package terminews and you will have access to ```$ news```. Running news will bring you the latest headlines and links to read the full stories 24/7/365.

### To Install Using NPM

- ```$ news```

* NOTE: This is version one, this project is in it's infancy. I have some grand visions for this one, or at least as grand as a terminal newspaper can be. I want to provide news, based on slants (left, center, right) using various sources. I want a more robust request system (more than one user-agent spoof, etc.). Contributions are welcome, The ball is rolling...
